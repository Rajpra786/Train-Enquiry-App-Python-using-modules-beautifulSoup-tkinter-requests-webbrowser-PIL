# Train-Enquiry-App-Python-using-modules-beautifulSoup-tkinter-requests-webbrowser-PIL
This is simple project for train enquiry app that takes data from a site(I used here cleartrip).
This app takes input as-Departure station code
                       -Arrivel station code
                       -Date
when you press "find trians" it gives a list of trains between these two stations on this given date and also it gives price for every catagery .By this page we can go directly to the irctc site.

version2.py is working 


thanks
